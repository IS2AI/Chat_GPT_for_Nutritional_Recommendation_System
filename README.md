# Chat_GPT_for_Nutritional_Recommendation_System

This repository contains the code, 50 different patient profiles and respective Chat-GPT responses on providing nutritional recommendations and sample diet plans. Patient profiles contrain easy, medium and difficult cases and various diseases. The project aim to evaluate the appication of large language models for nutritional recommendation systems.


Responses were evaluated based on the personalization, consistency with evidence-based recommendations/ guidelines, and practicality. 

Cases were developed and evaluated in three languages: English, Russian, and Kazakh. To overcome the problem of model performance for the underrepresented languages like Kazakh and Russian, additional step of translating the cases to English language before passing to Chat-GPT has been done.
